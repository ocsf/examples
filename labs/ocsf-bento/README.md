# OpenSearch Quick start 
This is a docker compose environment to quickly get up and running with a Bento, OpenSearch environment and MinIO as a storage backend.

**note**: If you don't have docker installed, you can head over to the [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
page for installation instructions.

## Usage
Start up the  servers by running the following.
```
docker-compose up
```
The OpenSearch dashboard server will then be available at http://localhost:5601
```
2. Drop you raw data set into the minio bucket that corresponds with the vendor data  
found here: http://localhost:9001/login.
```
user = admin
password = password

Once read the data will be deleted from the bucket and sent to the ocsf index you just created in Open search.
```

curl -s -XPUT http://localhost:9200/ocsf-3002-authentication/_settings  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"index.mapping.total_fields.limit": 10000}'
curl -s -XPUT http://localhost:9200/ocsf-3001-account_change/_settings  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"index.mapping.total_fields.limit": 10000}'
curl -s -XPUT http://localhost:9200/ocsf-6003-api_activity/_settings  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"index.mapping.total_fields.limit": 10000}'
```
index is set to ocsf-<class_uid>-<ocsf_bucket varrable>  
so ocsf-3002-authentication would be a class name.
```
3. proceed to Open search dashboard server and enjoy 

To stop everything, just run `docker-compose down`.
