// DataSecurityFinding is an OSF event in category "Findings"

// defined in ocsf events/findings/data_security_finding.json
//
// A Data Security Finding describes detections or alerts generated by various
// data security products such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Data
// Classification, Secrets Management, Digital Rights Management (DRM), Data
// Security Posture Management (DSPM), and similar tools. These detections or
// alerts can be created using fingerprinting, statistical analysis, machine
// learning or other methodologies. The finding describes the actors and
// endpoints who accessed or own the sensitive data, as well as the resources
// which store the sensitive data. Note: if the event producer is a security
// control, the <code>security_control</code> profile should be applied and
// its <code>attacks</code> information, if present, should be duplicated into
// the <code>finding_info</code> object. <br><strong>Note: </strong>If the
// Finding is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the
// <code>incident</code> profile  or aggregate this finding into an
// <code>Incident Finding</code>.

// The Application Security Posture Finding event is a notification about any
// bug, defect, deficiency, exploit, vulnerability, weakness or any other
// issue with software and related systems. Application Security Posture
// Findings typically involve reporting on the greater context including
// compliance, impacted resources, remediation guidance, specific code
// defects, and/or vulnerability metadata. Application Security Posture
// Findings can be reported by Threat & Vulnerability Management (TVM) tools,
// Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) tools, or other similar
// tools. Note: if the event producer is a security control, the
// <code>security_control</code> profile should be applied and its
// <code>attacks</code> information, if present, should be duplicated into the
// <code>finding_info</code> object. <br><strong>Note: </strong>If the Finding
// is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the
